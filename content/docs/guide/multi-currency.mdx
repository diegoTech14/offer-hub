OFFER-HUB provides native support for multiple assets, from stablecoins and native XLM to custom curated Stellar tokens, ensuring flexibility for all modern marketplaces.

## Supported Assets

Below is a list of the primary assets officially supported on the platform:

| Name | Symbol | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| USD Coin | USDC | Stablecoin |
| Stellar Lumens | XLM | Native Asset |
| Argentine Peso Token | ARST | Custom Stellar Token |
| Euro Token | EURT | Custom Stellar Token |

### Stablecoins

The most common settlement asset is USDC, providing price stability for buyers and sellers across your marketplace.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Stablecoin settlements typically incur lower volatility risk, making them the preferred choice for escrow.
</Callout>

### Native XLM

You can also use <Badge variant="primary">XLM</Badge>, the native asset of the Stellar network, which provides fast settlement and low transaction costs.

### Custom Stellar Tokens

OFFER-HUB can be configured to support other custom tokens issued on the Stellar network (e.g., ARST, EURT) by specifying the `issuer` address and `code` in the specific environment configuration.

## Automatic Conversion at Settlement

You have the ability to automatically convert assets during settlement. For example, if a buyer deposits XLM, the seller can receive USDC.

<Callout variant="note">
  Automatic conversion relies on path payments on the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Sufficient liquidity must exist between the assets to prevent excessive slippage.
</Callout>

## Configuration

To enable specific assets or set default conversion preferences, update your configuration in your integration environment.

Here is an example configuring supported currencies using our SDK or API:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{`
import { OfferHubClient } from '@offer-hub/sdk';

const client = new OfferHubClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OFFER_HUB_API_KEY,
  supportedAssets: [
    {
      code: 'USDC',
      type: 'stablecoin',
      primary: true,
    },
    {
      code: 'XLM',
      type: 'native',
    },
    {
      code: 'ARST',
      type: 'custom',
      issuer: 'GB...ARST_ISSUER_ADDRESS...',
    }
  ],
  settlementPreferences: {
    autoConvert: true,
    targetAssetCode: 'USDC',
    maxSlippageBps: 50 // 0.5% max slippage
  }
});
`}</CodeBlock>

<Callout variant="warning">
  Ensure that when adding `custom` tokens, the `issuer` address is completely verified and trusted to prevent spoofed tokens.
</Callout>
