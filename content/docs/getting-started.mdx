OFFER-HUB is a non-custodial escrow payment layer for modern marketplaces. It enables secure, trustless transactions between buyers and sellers without requiring you to build complex payment infrastructure.

## How It Works

OFFER-HUB uses a **balance-based ledger** and **smart-contract escrow** to protect every transaction:

1. **Buyer deposits funds** — USDC is detected on-chain and credited to the buyer's available balance.
2. **Buyer initiates an order** — funds are moved from `available` to `held` (escrow).
3. **Seller delivers** — on approval, held funds are settled to the seller's available balance.
4. **Withdrawal** — either party can withdraw their available balance at any time.

## Balance States

Every user has two balance columns:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `available` | Spendable funds — can be withdrawn or used to create orders |
| `held` | Locked in active escrow — released on settlement or cancellation |

## Supported Currencies

Both USD and XLM are supported natively. The currency is tracked per-balance record.
